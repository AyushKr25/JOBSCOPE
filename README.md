In today’s competitive job market, education and skills among individuals are becoming more advanced, leading to an increase in job seekers. However, this surge in applicants makes it difficult for companies to identify the most qualified candidates. To mitigate this issue, a more efficient and intelligent recruitment process is necessary. The online recruitment system discussed in this project helps by automating the application process and allowing candidates to apply for available positions on the company's website.

System Functionality:
This online recruitment system allows users to apply for job vacancies within a company. Interested candidates can register and create an account on the platform. Once registered, applicants can apply for open positions and receive updates regarding their application status. If the applicant qualifies for the job, they will interact with the system to follow up on their application’s progress.

The system is designed to be integrated into a company’s website, making it accessible to users globally. Administrators of the system, typically the company managers or HR teams, will post available job vacancies based on the company’s needs. This system ensures that job seekers can apply remotely, making it more accessible and efficient.

Roles and Privileges of Admin:
The recruitment system assigns different privileges to administrators at various levels. The system allows a clear distinction between higher and lower-level admins. A higher-level admin will have full control over the recruitment process, while lower-level admins will have limited access based on their privileges.

The administrator is responsible for managing the recruitment process and posting available vacancies. However, the evaluation process of candidates is company-specific, meaning that each company can set its own process for evaluating candidates, which might vary across different organizations. The admin privileges impact the functionality available at each level, ensuring that responsibilities and controls are clearly defined.

Lower-level admins are authorized to send requests to higher-level admins for approvals or changes. These requests can include things like adjusting candidate statuses, modifying job descriptions, or even approving or rejecting applications. Once a higher-level admin approves or disapproves a request, the lower-level admin will be notified about the result.
